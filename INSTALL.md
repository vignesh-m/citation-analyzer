Ensure you have Java RunTime Environment (JRE) with version atleast 7.
If not , download it from (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-se-jre-7-download-432155.html)

To install the citation-analyzer program simple copy the citation_analyzer.jar file .
The best way to execute it would be from the command line using `java -jar citation_analyzer.jar` from the directory 
containing the jar file.
